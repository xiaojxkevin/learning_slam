# Ahead of All 

*I may only record some of the key parts in the field of ==compouter vision== and ==SLAM== (or some other aspects). And we can always refer to《SLAM14讲》, "[An Invitation to 3D Vision](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~cer/arv/readings/old_mkss.pdf)" etc. for more details*. Besides some notes, I may put some of my small projects here, including homework from CS284 at ShanghaiTech as well as other practice materials.
